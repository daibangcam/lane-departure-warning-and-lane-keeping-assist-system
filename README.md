 In road-transport terminology, a lane departure warning system is a mechanism designed to warn the driver when the vehicle begins to move out of its lane (unless a turn signal is on in that direction) on freeways and arterial roads. These systems are designed to minimize accidents by addressing the main causes of collisions: driver error, distractions and drowsiness. 

 Systems which assist in oversteering, keeping the car centered in the lane, and asking the driver to take over in challenging situations (lane centering assist, LCA)
